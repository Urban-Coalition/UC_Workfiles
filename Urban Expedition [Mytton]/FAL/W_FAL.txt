Description:
C-308	Shipped back from Department du Nord, a land of constant snowstorm prohibits the use of conventional magazine. Take either 10 or 5 round load to fill up this machine
I-556	The South Division did not need such stopping power of a full blown cartridge, instead opted for a more conventional magazine in an intermediate calibre
